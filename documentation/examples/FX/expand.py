#! We construct a simple MX expression
x = msym("x",2,2)
y = msym("y",2,1)

z = mul(x,y)

#! Let's construct an MXfunction
f = MXFunction([x,y],[z])
f.init()

#! An MX graph is lazy in evaluation
print "Expression = ", f.outputExpr(0)

#! We expand the MXFunction into an SXFunction
fSX = f.expand()

print "Expanded expression = ", fSX.outputExpr(0)


#! Limitations
#! =============
#! Not all MX graphs can be expanded.
#! Here is an example of a situation where it will not work.
#!
linear_solver = CSparse(x.sparsity())
linear_solver.init()
g = linear_solver.solve(x,y)
G = MXFunction([x,y],[g])
G.init()

#! This function cannot be expanded.
try:
  G.expand()
except Exception as e:
  print e
